# diffqc: Differentiable Quantum Circuit Simulator for Quantum Machine Learning

diffqc is a python package providing differentiable quantum circuit simulator.
The main target is quantum machine learning.

diffqc is built on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so
that it is

  - GPU friendly,
  - easily vectorized,
  - differentiable, but
  - supported environments are limited. (Ref. ["Installation" section at JAX README](https://github.com/google/jax#installation))
